Security software is software that can make systems more secure like Antivirus or TLS or firewalls or VPNs.

But all software must be secure not just the security software. If someone sends you a pdf and you open it and the pdf viewer is not sandboxed well or has a buffer overflow in it...

Also security software itself can be not secure.

So **software security** talks about how secure your software is.
