The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is an open framework to help organisations  formulate and implement a strategy for software security that is tailored to the specific risks  facing the organisation. Resources are provided for the SAMM to enable an organisation to  do the following:  

1. Define and measure security-related activities within an organisation.  
2. Evaluate their existing software security practices.  
3. Build a balanced software security program in well-defined iterations.  
4. Demonstrate improvements in a security assurance program

- build and maintain abuse case models per project; specify security  
- requirements based upon known risks; and identify the software attack surface.
