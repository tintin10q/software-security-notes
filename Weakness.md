A weakness in software security is a potential security problem. Also called a bug. **Something that could go wrong & could be better**. But an attacker can not get to it because you need some special access. A [[Vulnerability]] is a weakness that attackers can get to. 

You got **feature bugs** and **parsing bugs**. 

- **Feature bugs** the langauge has a feature that works as intended but is just not secure like `getf` or `eval`. This is a **design flaw** that if you implement it correctly it can still go wrong. This is introduced before any coding. You also got wrong **configuration** where you can get insecure configurations. But this is still a design flaw. 
- **Parsing bug** where you are not using a good  parser and this allows uninteded things to happen. For instance not escaping things and you go from one langauge to the other then its interpreted in a different way. This is a **coding bug** like if you would have tested it you could have found it. 


You also got unforseen consequences like **spam** being the consequence of being able to send emails over the internet. SQL injection.
