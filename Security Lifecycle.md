We can not make software secure. But we can make software *more* secure. 

> Knolege  about standart mistakes is crucial. This depends on programming language "platform", api techonlogies used. Type of application.

There are lots of info on this and you should go over it. 

But this is not enough. You need to do secrutity at the start of the software security lifecycle. So this is the shift left. Moving from penetrate and patch to taking security into account from the start.

Besides [[DAST, SAST]] there is standerdiezed methodologies for securet software development:

- **Microsft SDL**
- BSIMM
- Open [[Samm]]
- Gary McGraw's Touchpoints 
- OWASP [[Samm]]
- Grip op SSD (Secure software development ) - Dutch goverment and Eric is involved. But a waste of time because its already been made but now they are just translating it.

These all come with best practices, checklists, methods for assessements, roadmaps for improvements. Same things just different words.
