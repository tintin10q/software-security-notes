- Lack of awareness of things that go wrong because it is not taught
- Lack of knowlege about things going wrong
- Irresponsible teaching of dangerous programming langauges like c(++)

- Javascript 
- SQL statementes

**Primary goal**  of software is providing features.
Managing risk is a secondary consern. 

"Security is only getting in the way of security" security typically looses here until it goes wrong. Also security bugs get less attention then functionality bugs.

If the parsing goes wrong anywhere its dead. This battle has been lost. But this is good for our jobs. 

Software runs on a huge complicated infrastrucutre build with complicated programing languagges and input langauges using various tools.  All of these may have security hols or may make the introduction of security holes very easy & likely.
